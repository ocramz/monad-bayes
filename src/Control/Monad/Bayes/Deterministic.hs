-- | A wrapper for deterministic code.
-- If a program doesn't actually use probabilistic effects,
-- but the type system can not ensure that,
-- `Deterministic` can be used to remove the `MonadBayes` constraint
-- in a type-safe way.

-- The first parameter is a numeric type used to represent real numbers.
