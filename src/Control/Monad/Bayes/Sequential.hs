-- | Represents a computation that can be suspended at certain points.
-- The intermediate monadic effects can be extracted, which is particularly useful
-- for implementation of SMC-related methods.
-- All the probabilistic effects are lifted from the transformed monad,
-- but also `suspend` is inserted after each `factor`.
